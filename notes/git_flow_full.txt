git add .-->this dot refers to our repository.This command tells git to add these files to our repository.
git commit -m "this is our first commit";-->this allows us to save a file at a particular point of time.
git log->shows a list of your commits
git log --author="akash"-->shows commits only for that particular person.

what happens when you add?

working copy>staging area>repository--->git workflow

working copy-is your current directory
stagin area is the place where your filess will sit when you add them
repository-final place where your files will sit when you commit them.


git diff-->shows the difference the file/files in your working directory and your main repository.
git diff --staged-->shows diif bewteen files in the staging area and the main repository.


git rm filename.txt-->removes the file from the working directory as well as the repository.

in git moving a file is the same as renaming it.

git mv filename.txt newfilename.txt--->same as git ren filename.txt newfilename.txt

git commit -am "added directly to the repository"-->will commit changes directly to the repository instead of first placing
it on the staging area using the add command.This is helpful in certain situations when you are making small changes to files.


UNDO CHANGES;
git checkout -- index.html-->checkout tells git to take this file from the repository and place it in your current working directory
and replace the file that existed before.This helps us undo unwanted changes in files.



UNSTAGE A FILE FROM THE STAGING AREA:
suppose you have added a file index.html to the staging area using add command.In order to bring it back to the current working
directory the command is:
git reset HEAD index.html



GET OLDER VERSIONS FROM GIT:

first>second>third--->want to get second again-->we dont delete the third but we just copy the second version to the current working
directory.
so after copying the version will look like.
first>second>third>second


git log-->shows the list of commits
git checkout commit_id -- index.html-->brings the file from the given commit_id to the current directory.
then add and commit the changes.


ADDING A FOLDER ON YOUR DESKTOP TO GITHUB:
git remote add origin <repository link>
git push -u origin master
